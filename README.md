## Overview
### Description
This app will allow MSU students to create accounts and enter in the classes they're currently in to help them find groups of people in the same classes. Once they've entered in their classes, we have a directory of students for each class with the student's socials they consent to sharing (snapchat username, instagram profile, linkedin page, etc.) It could also help people find student groupchats for courses. Our hope is that this helps people feel more connected to others in their courses while we're all still virtual. We could either have users manually enter their course information, or if there was a way to gain access to course information through MSU we could use that as well.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential because it allows students to instantly message each other.
- **Story:** With the ongoing pandemic, several students are having trouble meeting new people and finding people in their classes to study with. We recognized this problem, and this app could be a potential solution. 
- **Market:** This app can be useful to anyone that is a student at MSU. Students can find other students that are in the same classes as them and connect with them.
- **Habit:** Students can ask other students questions if they have any questions about the class throughout the day. They would also go on the app throughout the day when they receive notifications. Students will frequently be on this app when there is a big assignment or exam coming up.
- **Scope:** This is app narrowly focused. Users just  simply message each other. They can also view other user's socials.
